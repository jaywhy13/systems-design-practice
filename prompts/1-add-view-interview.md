Please update the app so we're able to view the interview chat after the interview has ended. 

Additionally, once the interview ends, add some resources that enhances the content of the interview. Use the following blogs to recommend similar articles that cover some of the concepts discussed in the interview. 

For each of the recommended articles, provide a summary that highlights the key elements of the related piece. Use the following blogs as sources:
- https://shopify.engineering/
- https://newsroom.aboutrobinhood.com/category/engineering/
- https://medium.com/pinterest-engineering

I should be able to click into the recommend article and see the summary of the key highlights. I also want a chat interface that allows me to dialog about the article and ask questions.
